# Team Basilisk Rover Control Website

Welcome to the control interface for the Team Basilisk Rover! This website has been developed for the Imperial Summer Year 1 project. This project aims to provide an intuitive and interactive platform for controlling and monitoring our rover.

## Overview

This website allows users to:

- View real-time coordinates and angles of the rover.
